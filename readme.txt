I uploaded the JSON file on a bin to have easy access.
    I provide a private-key in order to access it.
I created an empty HTML file with an empty unordered list.
    The list is filled with the orders recieved from the JSON file.
    Each list element is clickable and opens a new tab/window with more details.
        The new window contains all the required information, as well as a table with as many rows as the order's items.
Most HTML elements are filled using Javascript.
Minor CSS used to display the table nicely.
